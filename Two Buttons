/*
Pushbuttons sketch modified from sketch 5.1 in the Arduino Cookbook.
Switches connected to pins 2 & 3 lights the LED on pin 9 when pressed together
In this case both switches need to be closed (HIGH) to enable pin 9 to write HIGH.
The switches in this case are not physically connected but the states of each switch are determined by the 'digitalRead' function and the use of an 'if' statement in the sketch.
This could be handy if you want to initiate a particular action only if two sensors are activated.
